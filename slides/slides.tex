\frametitle{The role of the memory model}

Simulation of a litmus test is divided into two phases
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{herd7} first ``exhaustively'' generates all the
	executions of \\ the given litmus test

\vspace{2mm}
	\item it then filters out the executions which do not satisfy
	the constraints or \emph{axioms} specified by the memory model

Barriers take on a dual role:

%Which synchronization constructs can forbid the non-SC behaviors
%of my litmus test?
\begin{itemize}
	\item If all external links are \texttt{rf}-links, then the
	weakest order within each thread suffices

\vspace{2mm}
	\item If all but one of the external links are \texttt{rf}-links,
	then a release-\\acquire chain suffices

\vspace{2mm}
	\item If more than one of the external links are not
	\texttt{rf}-links, then a full memory barrier is required between
	each pair of successive non-rf links

\frametitle{This tutorial}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Seen several ``litmus tests'' to characterize the behavior
	of \\ source code

\vspace{2mm}
	\item Used the LKMM tools to verify that the code behaves as intended

\vspace{2mm}
	\item Described the fundamental concepts underlying the design \\
	of the LKMM ``by examples''

\vspace{2mm}
	\item Used memory barriers and other synchronization primitives \\
	to avoid undesired behaviors

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Using the LKMM -- for dummies}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Decompose your code}, expand function calls,
	structures \\ and arrays, remove ``extraneous'' instructions,
	\dots

\vspace{2mm}
	\item \emph{Do *think*} at the behavior of your code in terms
	of the \\ values read from or written to shared memory
	%(\texttt{rf} and \\ the other \emph{external links})

\vspace{2mm}
	\item %Need syncrhonization?  *Start simple*
	Try well-understood or common patterns, and move to \\
	``exotic'' synchronization \emph{only if} those don't fit your
	use % say, because they're not ``fast enough''

\vspace{2mm}
	\item Always, always!, \emph{check your reasoning} with herd7,
	\,this \\
	stuff used to frighten children and disconcert adults! \dots
	% ``faster crap is still crap'': a sane/correct design also matters
